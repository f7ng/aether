# Project *aether*

A project written in [golang](https://golang.org/) as an exploration of production-grade microservice built using open-source libraries/frameworks.

## Motivation

Learning a new language with an existing code-base subconsciously forces developers to adopt standards that at times are not standard and will not survive the test of time.
Having a personal project that is not time-sensitive, and does not need to conform to existing standards allows for experimentation and discovery of novel solutions to common problems.

As a developer moving from a large company to a startup, I was struck by the simplicity that internal tools and frameworks actually presented.

## Development
